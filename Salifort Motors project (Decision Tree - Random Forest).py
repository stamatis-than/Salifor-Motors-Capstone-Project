# ## Salifort Motors project
#  
# ### Provide data-driven suggestions for HR

# Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go). Salifortâ€™s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 
# 
# If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. 
# 
# As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover.  
# 
# Next, the leadership team asks you to analyze the survey data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest you design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. 

# ### **Whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?**

# ### Deliverables
# 
# Analyze the key factors driving employee turnover, build an effective model, and share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team.

# There is some positive correlation between number of projects, monthly hours and evaluation scores, and some negative correlation between employee leaves and satisfaction levels.

# ### Insights
# 
# It appears that employees are leaving the company as a result of poor management. Leaving is tied to longer working hours, many projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels. It can be ungratifying to work long hours and not receive promotions or good evaluation scores. There's a sizeable group of employees at this company who are probably burned out. It also appears that if an employee has spent more than six years at the company, they tend not to leave. 

# ### Identify the type of prediction task and the types of models most appropriate for this task

# The goal is to predict whether an employee leaves the company.
# 
# The outcome variable `left` can be either 1 (left) or 0 (stayed) which makes it a categorical outcome variable.
# 
# There are two types of models appropriate for this prediction task: 
# - Logistic Regression model
# - Tree-based Machine Learning model
# 

# ### Build a Tree-based model 

# **Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest**

# Before splitting the data, non-numeric variables must be encoded.
# 
# `department` will be dummied and `salary` because it's ordinal its levels will be converted to numbers (0-2).

# In[197]:


# Copy the dataframe
df_enc = df1.copy()

# Encode the `salary` column as an ordinal numeric category
df_enc["salary"] = (df_enc["salary"].astype("category")
                    .cat.set_categories(["low", "medium", "high"])
                    .cat.codes)

# Dummny encode the `department` column
df_enc = pd.get_dummies(df_enc, drop_first=False, dtype=int)

# Display the new datarame
df_enc.head()


# In[198]:


# Isolate the outcome variable

# The test scores are very similar to the validation scores, which is good. This appears to be a strong model. Since this test set was only used for this model, you can be more confident that your model's performance on this data is representative of how it will perform on new, unseeen data.

# **Feature Engineering**
# 
# In order to improve the model and avoid data leakage from occuring the next round will incorporate feature engineering.
# 
# There is a possibility that the `satisfaciton_level` and `average_monthly_hours` columns are a source of data leakage because either the satisfaction levels reported are not correct or employees that decided to quit or have been informed to be fired may be working fewer hours.  

# In[220]:


# Drop `satisfaction_level`

# ### Conclusion, Recommendations, Next Steps
# 
# The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 
# 
# To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:
# 
# * Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
# * Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
# * Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
# * If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
# * Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
# * High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort. 
# 
# **Next Steps**
# 
# It may be justified to still have some concern about data leakage. It could be prudent to consider how predictions change when `last_evaluation` is removed from the data. It's possible that evaluations aren't performed very frequently, in which case it would be useful to be able to predict employee retention without this feature. It's also possible that the evaluation score determines whether an employee leaves or stays, in which case it could be useful to pivot and try to predict performance score. The same could be said for satisfaction score.
